 Joe is a Roblox URL handler for Sober that makes things work as it should, no matter what app tries to launch Sober, because Joe is just a standup guy. 
 
 Whether it's running Roblox from Firefox, or with some extremely peculiar Linux black-magic, Joe's got you covered. 

 # Installing

 Just run "install.sh" in your terminal of choice WITHOUT sudo.
